# vue-firebase

In this project I used three features of firebase: Authentication (Email, password), Realtime Database and Storage.

Is possible upload images and videos and display them. Requires a basic authentication with e-mail and password

## Use
- Create a project on firebase
- On dist where you cloned the project you must duplicate '.env.local.example' file and set up your own data provided by firebase and save as .env.local
- Enable e-mail/password authentication method on firebase console
- Still at console, enable realtime database and storage (both on test mode, change it later if you want it)
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run serve` to run development server
